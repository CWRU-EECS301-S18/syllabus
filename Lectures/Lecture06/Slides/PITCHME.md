Note:

Morse_Code_Transmitter needed the rate_tick signal to be emulated for the simulation.  Best way to do this is copy the existing code that creates the signal in the real design.

### Coding Standards

* Indentation
* Variable / Module Naming
* File paritioning
* Comments

---

### Coding Style Tips

* Use a consistent coding style
* Uniform indentation for readability
* Help the next person with good comments
	* (Assume you're the next person)
* Follow the coding standard of the existing codebase
* Keep it Simple

---

## Serial Bus Protocols

* SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
* I<sup>2</sup>C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
* UNI/O (One-Wire)

---

### SPI BUS

* 3-wire (Clock, Bi-direction Data, Chip-select)
* 4-wire (Clock, Data In, Data Out, Chip-select)
* Many different device dependent protocols
* Point-to-point or shared bus using Chip Selects
* Used for interfacing Memory, ADCs, DACs, Accelerometers, JTAG, etc...
* Data rates 20MHz or greater (only limited by physical interconnect)

### I<sup>2</sup>C BUS

* 2-wire (Clock and Bi-directional Data)
* Shared multi-device bus using protocol addressing
* Standardized protocol by NXP Semi (fka Philips)
* Most devices support 400kHz Fast-Mode.
* Speeds up to 5MHz with latest Ultra Fast-Mode
* Used for device config, small memories, temp sensors, power supply controllers, etc...

### UNI/O BUS

* 1-wire (Clock/Data/Power)
* UNI/O is Microchip version of Dallas 1-Wire
* Shared multi-device bus using protocol addressing
* Used for ID chips and small sensors
* Encoded data bits to allow clock and power extraction from data line
* Bus rates between 10kHz to 100kHz

---

### State Machine Debugging

* Check State Variable to verify transitions
* Label States to make it easier to track

Note:
Live demo ModelSim looking at State Variable
